## 100DaysOfCode

#### Start: January 30, 2021

#### My Goals:

- code every day a bit
- build projects

### Day 1: January 30 , 2021

**Plans for Today:**
1. Nuxt.js course by Traversy Media
2. Start an app in Nuxt and Vue

**Today's Progress:**
1. Watched and code along Traversy Media crash course on yt.
2. Started the Coctail Recipes app using TheCoctailDB API. Created one page with recipes started with the letter m. 

**Thoughts:**
I like Nuxt but I know I won't be able to do much not knowing Vue. I think I need to start learning Vue properly first ;-)
