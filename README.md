## 100DaysOfCode

#### Start: July, 2023

#### My Goals:

- build one big project - at the time being I'm calling it "Thing"

I always wanted to do something with images. As I use images a lot in my daily job and a side project, I thought it would be a interesting topic for a coding project.

### Day 1&2: July 19 & 20 , 2023

**Today's Progress:**

1. I'm starting simple and exploring CSS filters and how to apply them on Canvas.

**Thoughts:**
At the moment I want to create custom filters, but first I need to read about filters in photography in general.
