## 100DaysOfCode

#### Start: January 30, 2021

#### My Goals:

- code every day a bit
- build projects

### Day 2: February 1, 2021

**Plans for Today:**
1. Learn some basic Vue: https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/
2. Add "pagination" to Cocktail App.


**Today's Progress:**
1. Went only through half of basic Vue tutorial

**Thoughts:**
I love that vue uses similar directives to those used by Angular. I don't remember much from Angular but I remember that I liked this part.

**Plans for tomorrow:**
1. Recreate the part I was learning today (but instead of building a table of employees, I'll do another todo app or contact list)
2. Continue Tania's tutorial https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-vue/

### Day 1: January 30 , 2021

**Plans for Today:**
1. Nuxt.js course by Traversy Media
2. Start an app in Nuxt and Vue

**Today's Progress:**
1. Watched and code along Traversy Media crash course on yt.
2. Started the Cocktail Recipes app using TheCoctailDB API. Created one page with recipes started with the letter m.

I like Nuxt but I know I won't be able to do much not knowing Vue. I think I need to start learning Vue properly first ;-)
