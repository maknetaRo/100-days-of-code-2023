## 100DaysOfCode

#### Start: July, 2023

#### My Goals:

- build one big project - at the time being I'm calling it "Thing"

I always wanted to do something with images. As I use images a lot in my daily job and a side project, I thought it would be a interesting topic for a coding project.

### Day 4: July21, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
I hit the wall. I want to access different functions on click but instead the last one is firing or none of them.

**Thoughts:**
Hope to find help reading about canvas experiments or googling a bit more tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 20, 2023

**Today's Progress:**

1. Scaled down an image to fit canva, but now the image is blury.

**Thoughts:**
Haven't read anything about filters or presets in photography but wanted to play a bit with filters in CSS. But as mentioned above, after scaling down an image, it's blury now. So now I need to fix this issue.

### Day 1&2: July 18 & 19 , 2023

**Today's Progress:**

1. I'm starting simple and exploring CSS filters and how to apply them on Canvas.

**Thoughts:**
At the moment I want to create custom filters, but first I need to read about filters in photography in general.
