### Day 21: March 1, 2021

## I decided to focus only on React in March. 

**Plans for Today:**
* work on custom select in React

**Today's Progress:**
* started my custom select from the beginning, but I have a few problems:
- I want to change the "header" part from "Choose a prize" into the actual prize and points, but it is an object and I don't know how to do it with objects;
- I'm not sure how to add a separate button to it that will trigger some computation

**Thoughts:**
Styled components are pretty nice. I'm glad I started learning it.

**Link to work:**

**Plans for tomorrow:**
* I may start another course that teaches more about hooks and functional components because I need them. I have also React Tutorial and Projects Course from John Smilga

**Resources:**
* React Tutorial and Projects Course

### Day 20: February 28, 2021

**Plans for Today:**

**Today's Progress:**
* Actually spent more than 8 hrs learning and coding:
- watched and followed a few parts of React course
- tried to create custom select using styled-components in React
- read about accessibility in custom select and tried to create custom select once again but couldn't make it work properly

**Thoughts:**
It was my best day for a long time. I was in a flow and it's a fantastic feeling.

### Day 19: February 25, 2021

**Plans for Today:**
* React course
* style select form

**Today's Progress:**
* watched 9 videos from the course
* started building react app using an old html/css/js project

**Thoughts:**
I couldn't focus on videos today. They were too theoretical. I think I will have to come back to some of them later. I want to do my own small project (at least part of it with adding api and searching through cards) before starting the final project from the course. 

**Link to work:**

**Plans for tomorrow:**
* watch some more videos
* work on select and some other CSS (nuxt)

### Day 18: February 24, 2021

**Plans for Today:**
- learn React
- work on zeton

**Today's Progress:**
* worked a bit on select form in React but haven't finished it yet
* watched more than 20 episodes of Complete React Developer in 2021 and coded along

**Thoughts:**
* need to stick to the course even though video courses aren't my fav way of learning; need to implement what I've learned in google font app; I mean I have a simple js app with google fonts and I could move it into React to practise.

**Plans for tomorrow:**

**Today's Progress:**
* not much progress: I came back to one component only because now I want to be able to sort columns and really don't know how to do it.

**Thoughts:**
Creating tables with data from api isn't as easy as I thought :-(. This conclusion made me a bit sad and made me start thinking again that I know nothing about programming thinking and how to change it.

* need to work on Zeton
* check how sorting was working in another project I took part in

### Day 13: February 18, 2021

**Plans for Today:**
- more on Vue components

**Today's Progress:**
1. read more about vue components and starting project with cli
2. started a new vue app but managed only to create one component

**Thoughts:**
In theory, props are easy but now when I want to build my own project without using any tutorial I have some problems with deciding what components I should build and how to pass data from parent component into a child component. 

Since master was replaced with main on Github I've got some problems with doing it properly. Instruction how to change master into main 
```
# Step 1 
# create main branch locally, taking the history from master
git branch -m master main

# Step 2 
# push the new local main branch to the remote repo (GitHub) 
git push -u origin main

# Step 3
# switch the current HEAD to the main branch
git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main

# Step 4
# change the default branch on GitHub to main
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/setting-the-default-branch

# Step 5
# delete the master branch on the remote
git push origin --delete master
```

### Day 6: Ferbruary 8, 2021

**Today's Progress:**
Haven't done much. Only a very small bit of CSS in Nuxt.js project. It's difficult for me to figurate where some things come from (in CSS) even though there are not many CSS files. 

---

### Day 4, 5: February 3, 4, 2021

**Thoughts:**
I was having a problem with ESLint for 2 days. I couldn't make it work and didn't know what it was and why I couldn't do anything in a project. I figured it out (at least I hope so) and started redoing some CSS in the Nuxt.js project. 

---

### Day 3: February 2, 2021

**Plans for Today:**
1. Learn Vue
2. Start css-redo.

**Today's Progress:**
1. Added random cocktail recipe to nuxt app. But only title, image, category and description. I don't know how to filter array from api in Vue.
2. Tried to run another project but had problems with dependencies (ESlint error)

**Thoughts:**
1. I don't know how to filter array from api in vue and how to create a component that uses only part of data from api. I'm using cocktail api. In each cocktail there are different ingredients. I want to create Ingredients component.
